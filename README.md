<h1>About the project</h1>

This project is based on the day 48 of the bootcamp <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/">100 days of code</a>, which I put the learning I had about web scraping and Selenium library into practice, developing a bot that plays the <a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">Cookie Clicker</a>.

<h1>how it works</h1> 
During  the time that was set in the DURATION constant, The bot will click on the cookie, and in every 5 seconds, it will check if a new power up is available to use. A power up that was previous selected, it won't be selected again.
